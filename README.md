George Benard, a 35-year-old software developer, is under investigation for allegedly  orchestrating a sophisticated credit card fraud scheme. Evidence suggests George  acquired stolen credit card information from the dark web, and his technical expertise  raises concerns that he may be employing anti-forensic techniques to evade detection.
During a raid, law enforcement seized George's laptop and Android phone for forensic 
examination. The investigation aims to confirm his involvement, identify potential 
accomplices, and determine the scale of the fraud. Additionally, a suspicious Portable 
Executable (PE) file discovered on his laptop has been flagged for analysis to ascertain 
whether it is malicious software linked to the crime or a benign file.
As part of the investigation, the following sources of digital evidence were collected for 
analysis:
• A forensic image of the hard drive from George’s PC.
• An XRY image extracted from the George's mobile phone.
• A PE sample from George’s PC.
